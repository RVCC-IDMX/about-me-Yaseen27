Description: This webpage has been a semester long project where each week we would learn a new skill we could implement on our webpages. Throughout the semester we learned skills such as embedding images and videos, navagation bars, contact forms, media queries, basics in html and css, etc. Throughout the semester it was fun, two things that were challanging though were making a responsive webpage on various different screen sizes; media queries were not the easiest to learn, and another thing that was difficult was properly embedding the videos because it was different and more difficult than images. This project taught me to be much more patient, organized, and become better at troubleshooting. Sometimes when trying to complete the project it had a few bugs that were difficult to fix but eventually most of the issues were fixed. 

Color Scheme: Originally my color scheme was different, but I decided to switch a few weeks after I "Painted" the webpage for the first time. For my background I chose a shade of light blue: #97B5E0; I did this so the other colors had good contrast with the it. I chose a dark bright purple: #6A0A8F for the background of the headers mainly; this helped with contrast between the normal background and the header font color which was a shade of dark green: #30B000. I also used the dark green mainly for border colors because it complimented the light blue well. I chose a shade of dark bright blue: #6039EB for most the other text on the webpage. I lastly used a shade of dull tealish blue: #106EB5 for a very little amount of text because I wanted to implement so different colors on lists to make it look more colorful. Overall I really liked this color scheme.
