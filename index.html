        <h2> CSS Animation Blog</h2>

        <div>

            <p>The topic I decided to talk about is CSS animations. CSS animations lets web developers create animated transitions of different objects throughout the webpage. There are multiple different properties in CSS animation which let developers be as creative as they want when they are creating these animations. CSS animations are also much more different that CSS transitions because animations can have multiple different motions compared to transitions. The animations are fluid and make the webpage a lot more visually appealing. A few properties that are used in CSS animations are @keyframes, animation-name, animation-duration, animation-delay, animation-iteration-count, animation-direction, animation-timing-function, animation-fill-mode, animation, etc. The @keyframes property lets the animation of the object change during a certain/given time. The animation property has sub properties in it. animation-name this sub-property lets the user specify the name of the @keyframe animation. animation-duration is another sub-property that tells the program how long it will take an animation to make one full cycle through that specific animation. This property also lets the developer choose the color of the animation when it is 0%, 25%, 50%, 75 %, and 100% complete.  animation-delay is a sub-property that tells the program when the animation cycle will start. animation-iteration-count is another sub-property and it specifies how many times an animation will be played/ how many cycles the specific animation will go through (it can go on forever as well if the specified time is “infinite”). animation-direction is a sub-property that tells the program if the animation will go forward, backwards, and even tells it if it should alternate between the two directions (can go forward and backwards; vice versa). animation-timing-function is the sub-property that tells the program how fast the animation speed will be in other words, it is a speed curve that specifies if it will go faster or slower than the normal animation speed, the speed can be linear, exponential, and more. animation-fill-mode is the sub-property where it specifies the style of the object before the animation starts, after it ends, or both. These are some of the properties and sub-properties of CSS animations. By using these properties the animation will look fluid, by moving smoothly, and it can also be unique because the web developer decides how creative the animations will be, The possibilities are endless when it comes to CSS animations which can make the website fun and visually appealing to the person using the website, which boost the attention of the viewer of the webpage. 

            Throughout the webpage I animated a few objects. One of them being the submit button at the bottom of the webpage, when the user hovers on the button it will wiggle back and forth. I really like this animation because of how it stops moving after the user removes the cursor from the button. Another thing I animated is the avatar picture. As you may have noticed, the image floats up and down. I really liked this one because the animation looks really smooth even though it is simple. The last thing I animated was a hovering effect on the photos on the webpage. They slightly expand when the cursor is hovering on the photo.
